# FastAPI Azure Sample Application Specification

## 1. Project Overview

This specification details a Python FastAPI application deployed as a Linux container on Azure App Service. The application displays all environment variables in an HTML table format and includes a health check endpoint. The application will be secured with Azure EntraID authentication and will integrate with Azure Monitor for logging.

## 2. Application Requirements

### Core Functionality

- Display all environment variables in an HTML table format
- Parse `FEATURE_FLAGS` environment variable as a comma-delimited list
- Include a health check endpoint that returns a standard status code
- Configure logging based on environment (DEBUG for development, INFO for staging, WARNING for production)
- Use default error pages
- Access secrets from Azure Key Vault using Managed Identity

### Technical Stack

- Python (latest stable version)
- FastAPI framework
- `uvicorn` ASGI server
- Docker container deployment

## 3. Infrastructure Requirements

### Azure Resources (via Bicep)

- Azure App Service
  - Linux container support
  - Smallest SKU that supports Linux containers
  - EntraID authentication with specific tenant ID and user role
  - Managed Identity for Key Vault access
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- Azure Container Registry for container image storage
- Azure Monitor integration

### Environment-Specific Configuration

- Development: DEBUG logging
- Staging: INFO logging
- Production: WARN logging
- Feature flags will vary by environment

## 4. Deployment Requirements

- Deployment via Azure CLI commands
- `Makefile` to orchestrate deployment steps
- Container deployment from Azure Container Registry
- Support for setting the `FEATURE_FLAGS` environment variable during deployment

```

## 6. Development Environment Setup

### Local Development

- Use Docker for local development with the same Dockerfile used in production
- Use `.env` file for local environment variables
- Docker Compose setup with appropriate environment configurations
- No need for local Key Vault integration

## 7. Detailed Implementation Requirements

### FastAPI Application

- Main endpoint that displays all environment variables in an HTML table
- Health check endpoint
- Configuration loading from environment variables
- Azure Monitor integration
- EntraID authentication integration (handled by App Service)
- Key Vault secret access via Managed Identity

### Infrastructure as Code

- Bicep templates for all required Azure resources
- Configuration for EntraID authentication with tenant ID and role specifications
- Container Registry setup
- Key Vault access policies for Managed Identity

### Deployment Automation

- Makefile with detailed deployment steps using Azure CLI
- Support for different deployment environments
- Container build and push commands

### Documentation

- README with deployment instructions
- Technical specification (this document)

## 8. Notes and Considerations

- No specific scaling requirements
- No specific network configuration requirements
- No backup or disaster recovery requirements
- No specific performance or resource requirements
- Default Python libraries to be used for Azure integrations
